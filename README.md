# 13F Filing Visualization and Analysis

This project aims to create a web application that retrieves and visualizes 13F filings data, representing the connections between financial institutions and the securities they hold. The application will leverage Maltego, a powerful open-source intelligence and graphical link analysis tool, to uncover hidden relationships and patterns in the data.

## Project Goals

- Collect and parse 13F filing data from reliable sources
- Store the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., database)
- Develop a backend API to serve the 13F filing data
- Create a user-friendly frontend interface to display the data and visualizations
- Integrate Maltego transforms to analyze and visualize the connections between institutions and securities
- Provide insights and analytics based on the 13F filing data

## Maltego Integration

This project leverages Maltego to visualize and analyze the relationships between financial institutions and securities. Maltego transforms will be developed to process the 13F filing data and generate meaningful entities and links.

The Maltego transforms will be implemented in Python and exposed as API endpoints through the backend server. The frontend application will make requests to these endpoints to retrieve the Maltego entities and links, which will be rendered using a compatible graph visualization library.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following main components:

- `backend/`: Contains the Node.js backend code for serving the API and handling Maltego transforms
- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend code for the user interface and data visualization
- `data_collection/`: Contains Python scripts for collecting and parsing 13F filing data
- `maltego/`: Contains Maltego-related code, including custom entities and transforms

Please refer to the individual component directories for more detailed information on their setup and usage.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the necessary dependencies for the backend and frontend
3. Set up the required database and configure the connection settings
4. Run the data collection scripts to populate the database with 13F filing data
5. Start the backend server
6. Launch the frontend application
7. Integrate the Maltego transforms and visualize the data

Refer to the detailed installation and setup instructions in the respective component directories.
